            You are more of a questioning person, and found the doctor's behavior a bit weird and forceful. Honestly, you just want 
            to check all your bases, so you go to an infectious disease specialist and a rheumatologist. To even find out about these 
            people, you had to really go out of your way. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The specialist tells you that the orthopedist was wrong, he was just trying to find evidence that you had lyme. Thank god 
            you didn't take that medication... who knows what would have happened to you. This firms your decision to not go back to 
            that orthopedist and go to the rheumatologist instead, the specialist agrees with your decision.

            The rheumatologist runs many tests on you, according to your symptoms, he diagnoses you with juvenile rheumatoid 
            arthritis, juvenile because of your young age. He starts you off with medication for your newfound autoimmune disorder. 
            Congrats, at least you found out what was wrong?
