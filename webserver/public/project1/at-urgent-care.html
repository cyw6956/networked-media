            You have no idea what has happened... You woke up today with a high fever, your knee twice its normal size, and you have 
            spotty vision. Your parents have brought you to urgent care, everything is hazy but you do remember a sharp pain... 
            oh yeah, they used a huge syringe to suck the fluids out of your leg. Even though the needle was thick and they didn't 
            use any numbing so it hurt like hell, the relief from it was insane. You finally wake up and your knee is its regular
            size again, but still a little sore so it is hard to move. They said they would send the fluids for testing... oh good
            something that can help you figure out what it is. Your appointment with the orthopedist is coming up though, you 
            will probably get some answers there...
