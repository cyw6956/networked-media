            You go to see another orthopedist and tell them about your experience so far and what you've been through. They 
            listen to your story seemingly thoughtfully and say, "I agree with your previous diagnoses, it does seem to be lyme. 
            Just take the medicine again, it seems to be working for a period of time? Your body is definitely reacting to it. That 
            is always a good sign."
        </p>
        <p>
            Since there is more than one doctor that agrees with it now, you decide to trust them and take the medication again 
            even though it is damaging your body and you have informed them of it. "That is just the nature of steroids." You really 
            hope that this time is the last.
