            the pain has gotten worse now, you don't think that you can carry on anymore like this, you decide to tell your mom. she, 
            to say it plainly, doesn't really care that much, but since you know how long it has been, you insist on going to the doctor.
            she finally agrees, and a few days later you show up to your pediatrician...
        </p>
        <p>
            you arrive to that same stark office, the parchment paper crinkles slightly as you sit down. the doctor's cold hand feels your 
            knee, she says at this time she can't really tell what it is, and you need to visit specialists. that honestly, she doesn't even 
            know who you should go see... she suggests orthopedics because it is your <em>knee</em> that is hurting after all, so you make an
            appointment to go there.
