            You have no idea what has happened... You woke up today with a high fever, your knee twice its normal size, and you have 
            spotty vision. Your parents have brought you to the orthopedist for answers, everything is hazy but you do remember a sharp pain... 
            oh yeah, they used a huge syringe to suck the fluids out of your leg. Even though the needle was thick and they didn't 
            use any numbing so it hurt like hell, the relief from it was insane. You finally wake up and your knee is its regular
            size again, but still a little sore so it is hard to move...

            "Hm, you don't seem to be turning up positive for 
            lyme. But in this --- strand you seem to be testing positive. Honestly, some people are just always positive here, but I think
            you definitely have lyme. I'll prescribe you with some medication."

            <a style="color: black" href="going-rogue.html">Wait what is happening??</a> Huh? I swear I already went through this once 
            before? Should I just take the medication again? But it was really painful last time, and... I don't even know. I guess I will 
            go with what he says.
