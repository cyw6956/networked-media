            The day of your appointment at the orthopedist's finally arrives, and you are so excited to go. Maybe you will finally 
            find out what is causing you all this pain and you can solve it once and for all. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You are sent to an exam room. The orthopedist comes in and you tell him all your symptoms. "Oh that is definitely lyme disease, 
            we have had a spike in it this year and so many people are catching it, do you remember if you've been bit by a tick these past 
            weeks?" You answer no, because as a hypochondriac, you would have known if you've been bitten. "Sometimes the bite is just too 
            small to see, that's normal. Here, we'll run some bloodwork and we'll see what turns up" 
        </p>
        <p>
            You go and get a lot of bloodwork done and go back to the orthopedist's. "Hm, you don't seem to be turning up positive for 
            lyme. But in this --- strand you seem to be testing positive. Honestly, some people are just always positive here, but I think
            you definitely have lyme. I'll prescribe you with some medication."
        </p>
        <p>
            <a style="color: black" href="going-rogue.html">But...</a> what if that isn't what it is? The doctor sounds convincing but 
            you aren't sure. You ask if there's a possibility if it's anything else. "No I think it is definitely lyme, you are still young too, 
            you will be thanking me because I caught it this early." Okay then, I guess this is it.
