            a week has passed by now, that dull pain is still there, never going away, but never getting worse either. you think to 
            yourself, how long should i wait until i tell my parents? it <em>has</em> already been a week of consistant pain. you 
            decide to stake it out for a few more days. whats the worst that could happen?
