            The medication the orthopedist prescribed is brutal, and he warned as much. It consists of anti-inflammatory 
            steroids and a pill that is just for lyme. Your stomach hurts everyday. The steroids are really taking its toll 
            on your body, but its ok, the medication is only prescribed for two weeks, you can make it through. Even though 
            you are now missing school often, your health is more important. You will get over this... right?

            You go back to the orthopedist after taking the medication in full. The inflammation in your knee has gone down, 
            so he just says you're good to go. So everything is ok right? That wasn't that bad.
