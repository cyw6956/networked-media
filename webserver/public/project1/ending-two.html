            You consult with a rheumatologist and they agree with the specialist. It seems to be rheumatoid arthritis. When the 
            doctor feels you knee, they are surprised by how much swelling there is. They put you on more anti-inflammatory 
            medication. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You go back to this doctor for a few more times, and you are feeling better and no more symptoms are showing up. 
            All of this medication has weakened you body, but what can you really do about that? Maybe you should take up going 
            to the gym.

            But it's all over now! You have found out what your illness is, and hopefully you can continue to trust this doctor 
            and they will help you recover... even though RA is a chronic condition. But still, congratulations.
