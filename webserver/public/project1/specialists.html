            Enough with the orthopedists, you declare. I will go straight to the source: the infectious disease specialist. 
            Lyme is an infectious disease, so it does make sense. You've booked an appointment and wait for the day to arrive.

            During your consultation, you mention how many times you've been on lyme medication. "You should not have been 
            put on that multiple times... what were they thinking? Your symptoms still came up after taking the medication 
            and they put you on it again?? They were not supposed to do that." The specialist explains to you that the 
            orthopedist was most likely trying to find evidence that it was lyme by using that --- strain that turned positive 
            as the backing. If the anti-inflammatory steroids worked though, it is probably just inflammation in the knee, and 
            that would be under the department of rheumatology.
