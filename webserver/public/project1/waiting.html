        you've made an appointment with the orthopedist, but there were no immediate openings, so you have to wait a long time. the 
        pain in your leg gets worse day by day, and it looks different... is it... growing bigger? you are so very worried, what is happening
        to your leg? you just hope that the orthopedist can figure it out. but it just is hurting so bad, as the days go by you can move
        your knee less and less. worries build up... you have so much homework to complete as well, and you're skipping practice. but what
        can you even do but wait?
