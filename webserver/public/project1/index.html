        <h2>What begins to be a normal semester...</h2>
        <p>
            you are starting your senior year of high school, it is a busy time. applying to college and the like, you probably remember the process. 
            on the bus on the way back from school, there is a dull pain on the side of your knee. it is very slight, but it is definitely there. you decide 
            to just ignore this pain, because a little ache here and there is normal, also it would be too much work to get it checked out. you remember 
            all the times you told your doctor about your stomach pains, nothing came of it anyways. but that afternoon you have tennis practice, it's 
            going to be such a pain...
