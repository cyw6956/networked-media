        <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
        <p>
            You might have a chronic condition now, <em>but at least you are aware of it.</em> Your distrust and questioning 
            nature has led you to shorten the process of finding out your sickness. Yippee!!... good for you I guess. Though 
            it really is nothing to be celebrating. Remember, this is really just the first step, being treated is a whole different 
            beast. But still, congratulations, at least you got out of this with the least amount of scars.
